# Tic Tac Toe

Build a Tic Tac Toe game where two players alternate turns.

## Requirements

- Display a 3x3 grid of clickable cells.
- Players alternate between X and O each turn.
- Show the current player before a move is made.
- Prevent a cell from being overwritten once selected.
- Detect a winner and display the winning player.
- Detect a draw when all cells are filled with no winner.
- Provide a "Restart" button that clears the board and resets turn state.
- (Optional) Highlight the winning line.

## Things to consider

- What should the data structure be?
- Can I derive as much as possible from existing state before adding more?
- Do I really need `useEffect`, or is it only useful for async calls and a few other scenarios?
- What's the bare minimum JSX I'll need to implement the core logic?
- Does my logic need to live inside the component or can it be a helper function?
- Once everything works, what bare minimum styling can I add?
